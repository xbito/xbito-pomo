Could the app check what you are doing in your PC?
    Seems like yes: https://chatgpt.com/c/3cece7ee-e43e-432f-af69-b08d062fb7a8 
    Even if the app is Chrome we could get the Tab out of the Window title it seems.

Maybe the app should connect to Google Calendar so it can:
    Detect a meeting, count it as pomodoro time. (How to detect a meeting?)
    Warn that a meeting is coming? (How to detect a meeting?)

Add a light/dark option. Currently it's dark theme only.

Add Detailed reports like Focus To-Do https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n8gpb2tk8gb?hl=en-US&gl=US
    A month calendar view that shows how many focus minutes you had per day. Like https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9p5zscl5qc8w?hl=en-US&gl=US

Integrate with YouTube Music.

Provide some Ambient White Noise?

Integrate with Gitlab?

Integrate with Google Calendar (add the session to your calendar once you start it, so the time can be "blocked").

Background filling to indicate Pomodoro time passing, different colors for different timer types.
